==========================================
 Tutorial 1: Getting Started with ReFrame
==========================================

.. versionadded:: 3.1

This tutorial will give you a first overview of ReFrame and will acquaint you with its basic concepts.
We will start with a simple "Hello, World!" test running with the default configuration and we will expand the example along the way.
We will also explore performance tests and port our tests to an HPC cluster.
The examples of this tutorial can be found under :obj:`tutorials/basics/`.


Getting Ready
-------------

All you need to start off with this tutorial is to have `installed <started.html#getting-the-framework>`__ ReFrame.
If you haven't done so yet, all you need is Python 3.6 and above and to follow the steps below:


.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/reframe-hpc/reframe.git
   cd reframe
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./bin/reframe -V

We're now good to go!


The "Hello, World!" test
------------------------

As simple as it may sound, a series of "naive" "Hello, World!" tests can reveal lots of regressions in the programming environment of HPC clusters, but the bare minimum of those also serves perfectly the purpose of starting this tutorial.
Here is its C version:

.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/hello/src/hello.c


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/hello/src/hello.c
   :language: c
   :start-after: // rfmdocstart: helloworld
   :end-before: // rfmdocend: helloworld


And here is the ReFrame version of it:

.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/hello/hello1.py


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/hello/hello1.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: hellotest
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: hellotest


Regression tests in ReFrame are specially decorated classes that ultimately derive from :class:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest`.
The :func:`@simple_test <reframe.core.decorators.simple_test>` decorator registers a test class with ReFrame and makes it available to the framework.
The test variables are essentially attributes of the test class and can be defined directly in the class body.
Each test must always set the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.valid_systems` and :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.valid_prog_environs` attributes.
These define the systems and/or system partitions that this test is allowed to run on, as well as the programming environments that it is valid for.
A programming environment is essentially a compiler toolchain.
We will see later on in the tutorial how a programming environment can be defined.
The generic configuration of ReFrame assumes a single programming environment named ``builtin`` which comprises a C compiler that can be invoked with ``cc``.
In this particular test we set both these attributes to ``['*']``, essentially allowing this test to run everywhere.

A ReFrame test must either define an executable to execute or a source file (or source code) to be compiled.
In this example, it is enough to define the source file of our hello program.
ReFrame knows the executable that was produced and will use that to run the test.

Finally, every regression test must always decorate a member function as the test's :func:`@sanity_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.sanity_function>`.
This decorated function is converted into a `lazily evaluated <deferrables.html>`__ expression that asserts the sanity of the test.
In this particular case, the specified sanity function checks that the executable has produced the desired phrase into the test's standard output :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.stdout`.
Note that ReFrame does not determine the success of a test by its exit code.
Instead, the assessment of success is responsibility of the test itself.

Before running the test let's inspect the directory structure surrounding it:

.. code-block:: none

   tutorials/basics/hello
   ├── hello1.py
   └── src
       └── hello.c

Our test is ``hello1.py`` and its resources, i.e., the ``hello.c`` source file, are located inside the ``src/`` subdirectory.
If not specified otherwise, the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.sourcepath` attribute is always resolved relative to ``src/``.
There is full flexibility in organizing the tests.
Multiple tests may be defined in a single file or they may be split in multiple files.
Similarly, several tests may share the same resources directory or they can simply have their own.

Now it's time to run our first test:

.. code:: bash

   ./bin/reframe -c tutorials/basics/hello/hello1.py -r


.. literalinclude:: listings/hello1.txt
   :language: console


Perfect! We have verified that we have a functioning C compiler in our system.

When ReFrame runs a test, it copies all its resources to a stage directory and performs all test-related operations (compilation, run, sanity checking etc.) from that directory.
On successful outcome of the test, the stage directory is removed by default, but interesting files are copied to an output directory for archiving and later inspection.
The prefixes of these directories are printed in the first section of the output.
Let's inspect what files ReFrame produced for this test:

.. code-block:: console

   ls output/generic/default/builtin/HelloTest/

.. code-block:: none

   rfm_HelloTest_build.err rfm_HelloTest_build.sh  rfm_HelloTest_job.out
   rfm_HelloTest_build.out rfm_HelloTest_job.err   rfm_HelloTest_job.sh

ReFrame stores in the output directory of the test the build and run scripts it generated for building and running the code along with their standard output and error.
All these files are prefixed with ``rfm_``.

ReFrame also generates a detailed JSON report for the whole regression testing session.
By default, this is stored inside the ``${HOME}/.reframe/reports`` directory and a new report file is generated every time ReFrame is run, but you can control this through the :option:`--report-file` command-line option.

Here are the contents of the report file for our first ReFrame run:


.. code-block:: console

   cat ~/.reframe/reports/run-report.json

.. literalinclude:: listings/run-report.json


More of "Hello, World!"
-----------------------

We want to extend our test and run a C++ "Hello, World!" as well.
We could simply copy paste the ``hello1.py`` and change the source file extension to refer to the C++ source code.
But this duplication is something that we generally want to avoid.
ReFrame allows you to avoid this in several ways but the most compact is to define the new test as follows:


.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/hello/hello2.py


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/hello/hello2.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: hellomultilang
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: hellomultilang


This test extends the ``hello1.py`` test by defining the ``lang`` parameter with the :py:func:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.parameter` built-in.
This parameter will cause as many instantiations as parameter values available, each one setting the :attr:`lang` attribute to one single value.
Hence, this example will create two test instances, one with ``lang='c'`` and another with ``lang='cpp'``.
The parameter is available as an attribute of the test instance and, in this example, we use it to set the extension of the source file.
However, at the class level, a test parameter holds all the possible values for itself, and this is only assigned a single value after the class is instantiated.
Therefore, the variable ``sourcepath``, which depends on this parameter, also needs to be set after the class instantiation.
The simplest way to do this would be to move the ``sourcepath`` assignment into the :func:`__init__` method as shown in the code snippet below, but this has some disadvantages when writing larger tests.

.. code-block:: python

  def __init__(self):
      self.sourcepath = f'hello.{self.lang}'

For example, when writing a base class for a test with a large amount of code into the :func:`__init__` method, the derived class may want to do a partial override of the code in this function.
This would force us to understand the full implementation of the base class' :func:`__init__` despite that we may just be interested in overriding a small part of it.
Doable, but not ideal.
Instead, through pipeline hooks, ReFrame provides a mechanism to attach independent functions to execute at a given time before the data they set is required by the test.
This is exactly what we want to do here, and we know that the test sources are needed to compile the code.
Hence, we move the ``sourcepath`` assignment into a pre-compile hook.

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/hello/hello2.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: set_sourcepath
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: set_sourcepath

The use of hooks is covered in more detail later on, but for now, let's just think of them as a way to defer the execution of a function to a given stage of the test's pipeline.
By using hooks, any user could now derive from this class and attach other hooks (for example, adding some compiler flags) without having to worry about overriding the base method that sets the ``sourcepath`` variable.

Let's run the test now:


.. code-block:: console

   ./bin/reframe -c tutorials/basics/hello/hello2.py -r

.. literalinclude:: listings/hello2.txt
   :language: console

Oops! The C++ test has failed.
ReFrame complains that it does not know how to compile a C++ program.
Remember our discussion above that the default configuration of ReFrame defines a minimal programming environment named ``builtin`` which only knows of a ``cc`` compiler.
We will fix that in a moment, but before doing that it's worth looking into the failure information provided for the test.
For each failed test, ReFrame will print a short summary with information about the system partition and the programming environment that the test failed for, its job or process id (if any), the nodes it was running on, its stage directory, the phase that failed etc.

When a test fails its stage directory is kept intact, so that users can inspect the failure and try to reproduce it manually.
In this case, the stage directory contains only the "Hello, World" source files, since ReFrame could not produce a build script for the C++ test, as it doesn't know to compile a C++ program for the moment.

.. code-block:: console

   ls stage/generic/default/builtin/HelloMultiLangTest_cpp


.. code-block:: none

   hello.c   hello.cpp


Let's go on and fix this failure by defining a new system and programming environments for the machine we are running on.
We start off by copying the generic configuration file that ReFrame uses.
Note that you should *not* edit this configuration file in place.

.. code-block:: console

   cp reframe/core/settings.py tutorials/config/mysettings.py


.. note::
   You may also use edit directly the supplied ``tutorials/config/settings.py`` file, which is the actual configuration file against which the various tutorials have been evaluated.


Here is how the new configuration file looks like with the needed additions highlighted:

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/config/settings.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: site-configuration
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: site-configuration
   :emphasize-lines: 4-17, 91-103

Here we define a system named ``catalina`` that has one partition named ``default``.
This partition makes no use of any `workload manager <config_reference.html#.systems[].partitions[].scheduler>`__, but instead launches any jobs locally as OS processes.
Two programming environments are relevant for that partition, namely ``gnu`` and ``clang``, which are defined in the section :js:attr:`environments` of the `configuration file <config_reference.html#.environments>`__.
The ``gnu`` programming environment provides GCC 9, whereas the ``clang`` one provides the Clang compiler from the system.
Notice, how you can define the actual commands for invoking the C, C++ and Fortran compilers in each programming environment.
As soon as a programming environment defines the different compilers, ReFrame will automatically pick the right compiler based on the source file extension.
In addition to C, C++ and Fortran programs, ReFrame will recognize the ``.cu`` extension as well and will try to invoke the ``nvcc`` compiler for CUDA programs.

Finally, the new system that we defined may be identified by the hostname ``tresa`` (see the :js:attr:`hostnames` `configuration parameter <config_reference.html#.systems[].hostnames>`__) and it will not use any environment modules system (see the :js:attr:`modules_system` `configuration parameter <config_reference.html#.systems[].modules_system>`__).
The :js:attr:`hostnames` attribute will help ReFrame to automatically pick the right configuration when running on it.
Notice, how the ``generic`` system matches any hostname, so that it acts as a fallback system.

.. note::

   The different systems in the configuration file are tried in order and the first match is picked.
   This practically means that the more general the selection pattern for a system is, the lower in the list of systems it should be.

The :doc:`configure` page describes the configuration file in more detail and the :doc:`config_reference` provides a complete reference guide of all the configuration options of ReFrame.

Let's now rerun our "Hello, World!" tests:


.. code-block:: console

   ./bin/reframe -C tutorials/config/settings.py -c tutorials/basics/hello/hello2.py -r


.. literalinclude:: listings/hello2_catalina.txt
   :language: console

Notice how the same tests are now tried with both the ``gnu`` and ``clang`` programming environments, without having to touch them at all!
That's one of the powerful features of ReFrame and we shall see later on, how easily we can port our tests to an HPC cluster with minimal changes.
In order to instruct ReFrame to use our configuration file, we use the ``-C`` command line option.
Since we don't want to type it throughout the tutorial, we will now set it in the environment:

.. code-block:: console

   export RFM_CONFIG_FILE=$(pwd)/tutorials/config/settings.py


A Multithreaded "Hello, World!"
-------------------------------

We extend our C++ "Hello, World!" example to print the greetings from multiple threads:


.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/hellomp/src/hello_threads.cpp


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/hellomp/src/hello_threads.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: // rfmdocstart: hello_threads
   :end-before: // rfmdocend: hello_threads

This program takes as argument the number of threads it will create and it uses ``std::thread``, which is a C++11 addition, meaning that we will need to pass ``-std=c++11`` to our compilers.
Here is the corresponding ReFrame test, where the new concepts introduced are highlighted:

.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/hellomp/hellomp1.py


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/hellomp/hellomp1.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: hellothreaded
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: hellothreaded
   :emphasize-lines: 10-10, 13-18


ReFrame delegates the compilation of a test to a :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.build_system`, which is an abstraction of the steps needed to compile the test.
Build systems take also care of interactions with the programming environment if necessary.
Compilation flags are a property of the build system.
If not explicitly specified, ReFrame will try to pick the correct build system (e.g., CMake, Autotools etc.) by inspecting the test resources, but in cases as the one presented here where we need to set the compilation flags, we need to specify a build system explicitly.
In this example, we instruct ReFrame to compile a single source file using the ``-std=c++11 -pthread -Wall`` compilation flags.
However, the flag ``-pthread`` is only needed to compile applications using ``std::thread`` with the GCC and Clang compilers.
Hence, since this flag may not be valid for other compilers, we need to include it only in the tests that use either GCC or Clang.
Similarly to the ``lang`` parameter in the previous example, the information regarding which compiler is being used is only available after the class is instantiated (after completion of the ``setup`` pipeline stage), so we also defer the addition of this optional compiler flag with a pipeline hook.
In this case, we set the :func:`set_compile_flags` hook to run before the ReFrame pipeline stage ``compile``.

.. note::

   The pipeline hooks, as well as the regression test pipeline itself, are covered in more detail later on in the tutorial.


In this example, the generated executable takes a single argument which sets the number of threads to be used.
The options passed to the test's executable can be set through the :attr:`executable_opts <reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.executable_opts>` variable, which in this case is set to ``'16'``.

Let's run the test now:

.. code-block:: console

   ./bin/reframe -c tutorials/basics/hellomp/hellomp1.py -r


.. literalinclude:: listings/hellomp1.txt
   :language: console


Everything looks fine, but let's inspect the actual output of one of the tests:


.. code-block:: console

   cat output/catalina/default/clang/HelloThreadedTest/rfm_HelloThreadedTest_job.out


.. code-block:: none

   [[[[    8] Hello, World!
   1] Hello, World!
   5[[0[ 7] Hello, World!
   ] ] Hello, World!
   [ Hello, World!
   6[] Hello, World!
   9] Hello, World!
    2 ] Hello, World!
   4] [[10 3] Hello, World!
   ] Hello, World!
   [Hello, World!
   11] Hello, World!
   [12] Hello, World!
   [13] Hello, World!
   [14] Hello, World!
   [15] Hello, World!


Not exactly what we were looking for!
In the following we write a more robust sanity check that can catch this havoc.


-----------------------------
More advanced sanity checking
-----------------------------

So far, we have seen only a ``grep``-like search for a string in the test's :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.stdout`, but ReFrame's :attr:`@sanity_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.sanity_function>` are much more capable than this.
In fact, one could practically do almost any operation in the output and process it as you would like before assessing the test's sanity.
In the following, we extend the sanity checking of the above multithreaded "Hello, World!" to assert that all the threads produce a greetings line.
See the highlighted lines below in the modified version of the :attr:`@sanity_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.sanity_function>`.

.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/hellomp/hellomp2.py


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/hellomp/hellomp2.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: hellothreadedextended
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: hellothreadedextended
   :emphasize-lines: 22-24

This new :attr:`@sanity_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.sanity_function>` counts all the pattern matches in the tests's :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.stdout` and checks that this count matches the expected value.
The execution of the function :func:`assert_num_messages` is deferred to the ``sanity`` stage in the test's pipeline, after the executable has run and the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.stdout` file has been populated.
In this example, we have used the :func:`~reframe.utility.sanity.findall` utility function from the :mod:`~reframe.utility.sanity` module to conveniently extract the pattern matches.
This module provides a broad range of utility functions that can be used to compose more complex sanity checks.
However, note that the utility functions in this module are lazily evaluated expressions or `deferred expressions` which must be evaluated either implicitly or explicitly (see :doc:`deferrable_functions_reference`).

Let's run this version of the test now and see if it fails:

.. code-block:: console

   ./bin/reframe -c tutorials/basics/hellomp/hellomp2.py -r

.. literalinclude:: listings/hellomp2.txt
   :language: console

As expected, only some of lines are printed correctly which makes the test fail.
To fix this test, we need to compile with ``-DSYNC_MESSAGES``, which will synchronize the printing of messages.

.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/hellomp/hellomp3.py


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/hellomp/hellomp3.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: hellothreadedextented2
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: hellothreadedextented2
   :emphasize-lines: 15


Writing A Performance Test
--------------------------

An important aspect of regression testing is checking for performance regressions.
In this example, we write a test that downloads the `STREAM <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffhammond/STREAM/master/stream.c>`__ benchmark, compiles it, runs it and records its performance.
In the test below, we highlight the lines that introduce new concepts.

.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/stream/stream1.py


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/stream/stream1.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: streamtest
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: streamtest
   :emphasize-lines: 9-11,14-17,28-

First of all, notice that we restrict the programming environments to ``gnu`` only, since this test requires OpenMP, which our installation of Clang does not have.
The next thing to notice is the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.prebuild_cmds` attribute, which provides a list of commands to be executed before the build step.
These commands will be executed from the test's stage directory.
In this case, we just fetch the source code of the benchmark.
For running the benchmark, we need to set the OpenMP number of threads and pin them to the right CPUs through the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` and ``OMP_PLACES`` environment variables.
You can set environment variables in a ReFrame test through the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.variables` dictionary.

What makes a ReFrame test a performance test is the definition of at least one :ref:`performance function<deferrable-performance-functions>`.
Similarly to a test's :func:`@sanity_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.sanity_function>`, a performance function is a member function decorated with the :attr:`@performance_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.performance_function>` decorator, which binds the decorated function to a given unit.
These functions can be used by the regression test to extract, measure or compute a given quantity of interest; where in this context, the values returned by a performance function are referred to as performance variables.
Alternatively, performance functions can also be thought as `tools` available to the regression test for extracting performance variables.
By default, ReFrame will attempt to execute all the available performance functions during the test's ``performance`` stage, producing a single performance variable out of each of the available performance functions.
These default-generated performance variables are defined in the regression test's attribute :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.perf_variables` during class instantiation, and their default name matches the name of their associated performance function.
However, one could customize the default-generated performance variable's name by passing the ``perf-key`` argument to the :attr:`@performance_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.performance_function>` decorator of the associated performance function.

In this example, we extract four performance variables, namely the memory bandwidth values for each of the "Copy", "Scale", "Add" and "Triad" sub-benchmarks of STREAM, where each of the performance functions use the :func:`~reframe.utility.sanity.extractsingle` utility function.
For each of the sub-benchmarks we extract the "Best Rate MB/s" column of the output (see below) and we convert that to a float.

.. code-block:: none

   Function    Best Rate MB/s  Avg time     Min time     Max time
   Copy:           24939.4     0.021905     0.021527     0.022382
   Scale:          16956.3     0.031957     0.031662     0.032379
   Add:            18648.2     0.044277     0.043184     0.046349
   Triad:          19133.4     0.042935     0.042089     0.044283


Let's run the test now:


.. code-block:: console

   ./bin/reframe -c tutorials/basics/stream/stream1.py -r --performance-report

The :option:`--performance-report` will generate a short report at the end for each performance test that has run.


.. literalinclude:: listings/stream1.txt
   :language: console


---------------------------------------------------
Setting explicitly the test's performance variables
---------------------------------------------------

In the above STREAM example, all four performance functions were almost identical except for a small part of the regex pattern, which led to some code repetition.
Even though the performance functions were rather simple and the code repetition was not much in that case, this is still not a good practice and it is certainly an approach that would not scale when using more complex performance functions.
Hence, in this example, we show how to collapse all these four performance functions into a single function and how to reuse this single performance function to create multiple performance variables.

.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/stream/stream2.py

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/stream/stream2.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: streamtest2
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: streamtest2
   :emphasize-lines: 28-

As shown in the highlighted lines, this example collapses the four performance functions from the previous example into the :func:`extract_bw` function, which is also decorated with the :attr:`@performance_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.performance_function>` decorator with the units set to ``'MB/s'``.
However, the :func:`extract_bw` function now takes the optional argument ``kind`` which selects the STREAM benchmark to extract.
By default, this argument is set to ``'Copy'`` because functions decorated with :attr:`@performance_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.performance_function>` are only allowed to have ``self`` as a non-default argument.
Thus, from this performance function definition, ReFrame will default-generate a single performance variable during the test instantiation under the name ``extract_bw``, where this variable will report the performance results from the ``Copy`` benchmark.
With no further action from our side, ReFrame would just report the performance of the test based on this default-generated performance variable, but that is not what we are after here.
Therefore, we must modify these default performance variables so that this version of the STREAM test produces the same results as in the previous example.
As mentioned before, the performance variables (also the default-generated ones) are stored in the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.perf_variables` dictionary, so all we need to do is to redefine this mapping with our desired performance variables as done in the pre-performance pipeline hook :func:`set_perf_variables`.

.. tip::
   Performance functions may also be generated inline using the :func:`~reframe.utility.sanity.make_performance_function` utility as shown below.

   .. code-block:: python

      @run_before('performance')
      def set_perf_vars(self):
          self.perf_variables = {
              'Copy': sn.make_performance_function(
                  sn.extractsingle(r'Copy:\s+(\S+)\s+.*',
                                   self.stdout, 1, float),
                  'MB/s'
               )
          }

-----------------------
Adding reference values
-----------------------

On its current state, the above STREAM performance test will simply extract and report the performance variables regardless of the actual performance values.
However, in some situations, it might be useful to check that the extracted performance values are within an expected range, and report a failure whenever a test performs below expectations.
To this end, ReFrame tests include the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.reference` variable, which enables setting references for each of the performance variables defined in a test and also set different references for different systems.
In the following example, we set the reference values for all the STREAM sub-benchmarks for the system we are currently running on.

.. note::

   Optimizing STREAM benchmark performance is outside the scope of this tutorial.


.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/stream/stream3.py


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/stream/stream3.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: streamtest3
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: streamtest3
   :emphasize-lines: 18-25


The performance reference tuple consists of the reference value, the lower and upper thresholds expressed as fractional numbers relative to the reference value, and the unit of measurement.
If any of the thresholds is not relevant, :class:`None` may be used instead.
Also, the units in this :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.reference` variable are entirely optional, since they were already provided through the :attr:`@performance_function<reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionMixin.performance_function>` decorator.

If any obtained performance value is beyond its respective thresholds, the test will fail with a summary as shown below:

.. code-block:: console

   ./bin/reframe -c tutorials/basics/stream/stream3.py -r --performance-report

.. literalinclude:: listings/stream3_failure_only.txt
   :language: console

------------------------------
Examining the performance logs
------------------------------

ReFrame has a powerful mechanism for logging its activities as well as performance data.
It supports different types of log channels and it can send data simultaneously in any number of them.
For example, performance data might be logged in files and at the same time being sent to Syslog or to a centralized log management server.
By default (i.e., starting off from the builtin configuration file), ReFrame sends performance data to files per test under the ``perflogs/`` directory:

.. code-block:: none

   perflogs
   └── catalina
       └── default
           ├── StreamTest.log
           └── StreamWithRefTest.log

ReFrame creates a log file per test per system and per partition and appends to it every time the test is run on that system/partition combination.
Let's inspect the log file from our last test:

.. code-block:: console

   tail perflogs/catalina/default/StreamWithRefTest.log

Several information are printed for each run, such as the performance variables, their value, their references and thresholds etc.
The default format is in a form suitable for easy parsing, but you may fully control not only the format, but also what is being logged from the configuration file.
:doc:`configure` and :doc:`config_reference` cover logging in ReFrame in much more detail.



Porting The Tests to an HPC cluster
-----------------------------------

It's now time to port our tests to an HPC cluster.
Obviously, HPC clusters are much more complex than our laptop or PC.
Usually there are many more compilers, the user environment is handled in a different way, and the way to launch the tests varies significantly, since you have to go through a workload manager in order to access the actual compute nodes.
Besides that, there might be multiple types of compute nodes that we would like to run our tests on, but each type might be accessed in a different way.
It is already apparent that porting even an as simple as a "Hello, World" test to such a system is not that straightforward.
As we shall see in this section, ReFrame makes that pretty easy.

--------------------------
Adapting the configuration
--------------------------

Our target system is the `Piz Daint <https://www.cscs.ch/computers/piz-daint/>`__ supercomputer at CSCS, but you can adapt the process to your target HPC system.
In ReFrame, all the details of the various interactions of a test with the system environment are handled transparently and are set up in its configuration file.
Let's extend our configuration file for Piz Daint.


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/config/settings.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: site-configuration
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: site-configuration
   :emphasize-lines: 32-90,114-145,158-164


First of all, we need to define a new system and set the list of hostnames that will help ReFrame identify it.
We also set the :js:attr:`modules_system <.systems[].modules_system>` `configuration parameter <config_reference.html#.systems[].modules_system>`__ to instruct ReFrame that this system makes use of the `environment modules <http://modules.sourceforge.net/>`__ for managing the user environment.
Then we define the system partitions that we want to test.
In this case, we define three partitions:

1. the login nodes,
2. the multicore partition (2x Broadwell CPUs per node) and
3. the hybrid partition (1x Haswell CPU + 1x Pascal GPU).

.. |srun| replace:: :obj:`srun`
.. _srun: https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html

The login nodes are pretty much similar to the ``catalina:default`` partition which corresponded to our laptop: tests will be launched and run locally.
The other two partitions are handled by `Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>`__ and parallel jobs are launched using the |srun|_ command.
Additionally, in order to access the different types of nodes represented by those partitions, users have to specify either ``-C mc`` or ``-C gpu`` options along with their account.
This is what we do exactly with the :js:attr:`access` partition configuration option.

.. note::

   System partitions in ReFrame do not necessarily correspond to real job scheduler partitions.

Piz Daint's programming environment offers four compilers: Cray, GNU, Intel and PGI.
We want to test all of them, so we include them in the :js:attr:`environs` lists.
Notice that we do not include Clang in the list, since there is no such compiler on this particular system.
On the other hand, we include a different version of the ``builtin`` environment, which corresponds to the default login environment without loading any modules.
It is generally useful to define such an environment so as to use it for tests that are running simple utilities and don't need to compile anything.

Before looking into the definition of the new environments for the four compilers, it is worth mentioning the :js:attr:`max_jobs` parameter.
This parameter specifies the maximum number of ReFrame test jobs that can be simultaneously in flight.
ReFrame will try to keep concurrency close to this limit (but not exceeding it).
By default, this is set to ``8``, so you are advised to set it to a higher number if you want to increase the throughput of completed tests.

The new environments are defined similarly to the ones we had for our local system, except that now we set two more parameters: the :js:attr:`modules` and the :js:attr:`target_systems`.
The :js:attr:`modules` parameter is a list of environment modules that needs to be loaded, in order to make available this compiler.
The :js:attr:`target_systems` parameter restricts the environment definition to a list of specific systems or system partitions.
This allows us to redefine environments for different systems, as for example the ``gnu`` environment in this case.
ReFrame will always pick the definition that is a closest match for the current system.
In this example, it will pick the second definition for ``gnu`` whenever it runs on the system named ``daint``, and the first in every other occasion.

-----------------
Running the tests
-----------------

We are now ready to run our tests on Piz Daint.
We will only do so with the final versions of the tests from the previous section, which we will select using :option:`-n` option.

.. code-block:: console

   export RFM_CONFIG_FILE=$(pwd)/tutorials/config/settings.py
   ./bin/reframe -c tutorials/basics/ -R -n 'HelloMultiLangTest|HelloThreadedExtended2Test|StreamWithRefTest' --performance-report -r

.. literalinclude:: listings/alltests_daint.txt
   :language: console

There it is!
Without any change in our tests, we could simply run them in a HPC cluster with all of its intricacies.
Notice how our original four tests expanded to more than 40 test cases on that particular HPC cluster!
One reason we could run immediately our tests on a new system was that we have not been restricting neither the valid system they can run nor the valid programming environments they can run with (except for the STREAM test).
Otherwise we would have to add ``daint`` and its corresponding programming environments in :attr:`valid_systems` and :attr:`valid_prog_environs` lists respectively.

.. tip::

   A quick way to try a test on a new system, if it's not generic, is to pass the :option:`--skip-system-check` and the :option:`--skip-prgenv-check` command line options which will cause ReFrame to skip any test validity checks for systems or programming environments.

Although the tests remain the same, ReFrame has generated completely different job scripts for each test depending on where it was going to run.
Let's check the job script generated for the ``StreamWithRefTest``:

.. code-block:: console

   cat output/daint/gpu/gnu/StreamWithRefTest/rfm_StreamWithRefTest_job.sh

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --job-name="rfm_StreamWithRefTest_job"
   #SBATCH --ntasks=1
   #SBATCH --output=rfm_StreamWithRefTest_job.out
   #SBATCH --error=rfm_StreamWithRefTest_job.err
   #SBATCH --time=0:10:0
   #SBATCH -A csstaff
   #SBATCH --constraint=gpu
   module unload PrgEnv-cray
   module load PrgEnv-gnu
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
   export OMP_PLACES=cores
   srun ./StreamWithRefTest

Whereas the exact same test running on our laptop was as simple as the following:


.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
   export OMP_PLACES=cores
    ./StreamWithRefTest

In ReFrame, you don't have to care about all the system interaction details, but rather about the logic of your tests as we shall see in the next section.


-----------------------------------------------------------
Adapting a test to new systems and programming environments
-----------------------------------------------------------

Unless a test is rather generic, you will need to make some adaptations for the system that you port it to.
In this case, we will adapt the STREAM benchmark so as to run it with multiple compiler and adjust its execution based on the target architecture of each partition.
Let's see and comment the changes:

.. code-block:: console

   cat tutorials/basics/stream/stream4.py

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/basics/stream/stream4.py
   :start-after: # rfmdocstart: streamtest4
   :end-before: # rfmdocend: streamtest4
   :emphasize-lines: 8, 27-41, 43-56

First of all, we need to add the new programming environments in the list of the supported ones.
Now there is the problem that each compiler has its own flags for enabling OpenMP, so we need to differentiate the behavior of the test based on the programming environment.
For this reason, we define the flags for each compiler in a separate dictionary (``flags`` variable) and we set them in the :func:`set_compiler_flags` pipeline hook.
We have first seen the pipeline hooks in the multithreaded "Hello, World!" example and now we explain them in more detail.
When ReFrame loads a test file, it instantiates all the tests it finds in it.
Based on the system ReFrame runs on and the supported environments of the tests, it will generate different test cases for each system partition and environment combination and it will finally send the test cases for execution.
During its execution, a test case goes through the *regression test pipeline*, which is a series of well defined phases.
Users can attach arbitrary functions to run before or after any pipeline stage and this is exactly what the :func:`set_compiler_flags` function is.
We instruct ReFrame to run this function before the test enters the ``compile`` stage and set accordingly the compilation flags.
The system partition and the programming environment of the currently running test case are available to a ReFrame test through the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.current_partition` and :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.current_environ` attributes respectively.
These attributes, however, are only set after the first stage (``setup``) of the pipeline is executed, so we can't use them inside the test's constructor.

We do exactly the same for setting the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environment variables depending on the system partition we are running on, by attaching the :func:`set_num_threads` pipeline hook to the ``run`` phase of the test.
In that same hook we also set the :attr:`~reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.num_cpus_per_task` attribute of the test, so as to instruct the backend job scheduler to properly assign CPU cores to the test.
In ReFrame tests you can set a series of task allocation attributes that will be used by the backend schedulers to emit the right job submission script.
The section :ref:`scheduler_options` of the :doc:`regression_test_api` summarizes these attributes and the actual backend scheduler options that they correspond to.

For more information about the regression test pipeline and how ReFrame executes the tests in general, have a look at :doc:`pipeline`.

.. note::

   ReFrame tests are ordinary Python classes so you can define your own attributes as we do with :attr:`flags` and :attr:`cores` in this example.

Let's run our adapted test now:

.. code-block:: console

   ./bin/reframe -c tutorials/basics/stream/stream4.py -r --performance-report


.. literalinclude:: listings/stream4_daint.txt
   :language: console

Notice the improved performance of the benchmark in all partitions and the differences in performance between the different compilers.

This concludes our introductory tutorial to ReFrame!
